# Solar Power Prediction Project

This repository contains the open-source materials related to our academic paper on solar power prediction. The main technologies, including the photovoltaic power prediction model and dataset processing methods, will be open-sourced upon the paper's publication.

## Dataset

The processed dataset we collected has been uploaded to Kaggle. You are welcome to download it from [Kaggle Link - To be added].

## Solar Power Prediction Platform

We have also developed a solar power prediction platform that allows for one-click dataset processing and includes multiple pre-trained neural network models, such as STRFN. This platform is currently under development and in the commercialization phase, and therefore, it is not open-source at this time. You can see a demo of the platform in the following GIFs:
